                <h2>New York City Cement Tiles</h2>
                <br>When you are looking for a new home, one of the most important aspects to help inform your decision is how structurally sound the house has been constructed.  Using good materials should always outweigh getting away with something on the cheap. Cement tiles from <a href="http://nycementtile.com/">NY Cement Tile</a> are guaranteed in quality and will exceed what you have come to expect from a tile. This material not only looks gorgeous, it is strong and lasts longer than traditional porcelain or ceramic tiles. And the textured appearance makes it stand out both indoors and outdoors. <br>

<br>Our clients are constantly sending us photos and reviews to tell us how gorgeous the project came out using our cement tiles. And we have created some beautiful <a href="http://nycementtile.com/">handmade cement tiles</a> since we can create pretty much any design from scratch. When we receive an order, we call the client first, to make sure they understand exactly what design they want and what quantity. It is important to understand that cement tiles look custom made for a reason. They develop a natural worn look over time because they are not hand painted on the surface like porcelain tiles. Cement tiles are solid (and heavy) tiles and the design goes all the way through. Essentially, there is no top or bottom since it looks the same on both sides. When you pick them up them you will feel the exceptional quality and durability. <br>

<br>We can help you pick out the proper cement tile for your project. If you would like to learn more about the <a href="http://nycementtile.com/">beauty of cement tiles</a>, check out our website or give us a call to order a sample. We will work with you to come up with the cement tile design you need for any space and help pick out the perfect tiles for your project.<br> <br>

                Cement tiles can be used in any room for a multitude of purposes. We have seen them as a cement tile kitchen backsplash and a façade in front of a garden. We have seen cement tile porches and cement tile walls in just about any room in the house. We have also seen <a href="http://nycementtile.com/pages/hexagon.html">cement tile flooring</a> in restaurants and other commercial spaces. We have even spotted cement tiles at a sporting arena in Italy! <br><br>
But the real beauty of getting cement tiles for your home or business is making them your own. That is why at <a href="http://nycementtile.com/pages/hexagon.html">New York Cement Tile</a>, we allow you to customize the tile shape, color, pattern and even the design itself.
